## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my vacation itineraty, this is using the best laid plans to make a perfect vacation itinerary:

NO PLANS!!!

Complete randomness using Python.random function and some minor filtering by temperature and you have a list of cities and hotels that will meet your two needs, max and min. The only thing you have to do is get an API key from these two sites:

https://home.openweathermap.org/ for the weather APIs

https://console.cloud.google.com/ for the Google APIs

And paste the key into the config file where it says "INSERT YOUR KEY HERE".

Then you are ready to go and utilize this yourself!
