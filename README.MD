## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my vacation itineraty, this is using the best laid plans of people like myself to make a perfect vacation itinerary:

NO PLANS!!!

Complete randomness of your travel destinations!! Using Python.random function and some minor filtering by temperature and you have a list of cities and hotels that will meet your two needs, max and min temperatures. Maybe you are cold blooded and want those amazing tropical destinations or the arctic and Alaska fits your hot self want to see the Northern-Lights!! 

The only thing you have to do is get an API key from these two sites:

https://home.openweathermap.org/ for the weather APIs

https://console.cloud.google.com/ for the Google APIs

And paste the key into the config file where it says "INSERT YOUR KEY HERE".

Then you are ready to go and utilize this yourself!
